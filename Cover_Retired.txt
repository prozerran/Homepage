Dear Employer -

I have nearly 20 years of professional software development experience, and I am RETIRED!

How about -50% off from your base salary sounds?

You are a SME willing to offer 50k HKD? I'm willing to accept 25k!
You are in Fintech/iBank/Web3 and offer 80k HKD? I'm willing to accept 40k!
You are a startup with a very tight budget and can only offer 20k? Well, I'm willing to work for you at 10k!

YES. THATS RIGHT. -50% OFF from YOUR base offer, whatever it is. I am willing to do.

My qualifications....

So WHY am I willing to accept work at such low salary?
Well, because I am partially retired and ONLY looking for work that is relaxing, that is, any of the....

- hybrid, remote, WFH, part-time, contract, short-term, freelance, or otherwise easy work where I can automate my task.
- In other words, NO MORE full time on-site work in office anymore.
