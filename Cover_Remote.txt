Dear Employer -

I have over 18+ years of professional programming experience, have worked in US/Silicon Valley, fluent in English and spoken Cantonese, and now looking to find more challenging work. 
My area of expertise include C/C++, C# .NET, and some web development.

I am a US citizen but currently based in Hong Kong, so I can only work remotely (unless your office is based in HK)
therefore, I am willing to accept a lower salary compared to standard market rate.
    
In brief:

- Thorough understanding of C++ and C# .NET 6/7
- OOP, Design Patterns, MVC, WPF, MVVM, SOLID principles
- TCP/IP Socket and network programming
- Multi-threaded, asynchronous, event driven development
- WebApi, WebSockets, MessageQueues, Micro-Services
- Fullstack, DB/SQL, IIS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- Linux, Bash, shell scripts, cron jobs, administration
- Agile development methodology
