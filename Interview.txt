Interview


I have nearly 20 years experience as a software developer, mostly focusing on financial markets. I started as a C++ developer back in the US, then moved to HK around 2008
I continue to be a C++ programmer then gradually moved to C# development, and have been do so for the past 10 years.
I have worked for a few company all dealing with fintech, buidling trading applications, OMS, market making, and FIX connectivity, on multiple version, such as 4.2, 4.4, 5.0 both SP1 and SP2
I am especially adept on FIX connectivity using QuickFix in C#, both in market data, order execution, debugging, troubleshooting as I understand the FIX protool pretty well, even to the point of leading a team and creating our own tags to deal with special situations.

    
In brief:

- Thorough understanding of C++ and C# .NET 6/7/8
- OOP, Design Patterns, MVC, WPF, SOLID principles
- Fintech, OMS, FIX, Market Data, OTC, DMA, Exchanges
- High Frequency/Low Latency, market making
- ETF, equities and derivative pricing, Black-Scholes model
- Blockchain, cryptocurrencies trading platform
- Multi-threaded, asynchronous, event driven development
- Agile development methodology 


FIX connectivity to exchanges
- CME, 
- TT, SEHK, CBOE, NYSE, NASDAQ, ICE, CBOE
- IB, Phillips
- AAX, 10kM
- Bitfinex
- Challenge on FIX, its usually issues on the counterparty, which i had to email their L1 support to help with the FIX connection issues.
They usually escalate my issues to L2/L3 or directly to the develpers as my requirements are very rare.

Annoying while doing FIX connectivity and having L1 support from my counterpartie
both on the buy and sell side institutions.
I always send my FIX logs to them as is, with the SOH characters intact, however, their response is almost always in email with their own
FIX log without the SOH character and replaced with the space character, which i find annoying, i had to replace them to 'fix' it in order for me to debug,
process, and parse the data


Ambition
- I just want to resolve issues for your clients in a timely manner. Given my experience with FIX connectivity, and programming knowledge using QuickFIX,
i dont see that much of a problem as i have been debugging on FIX platforms for about 10 years.
- I would like to point out that besides a a developer in fintech, I am a part time trader myself, i have both open positions both in long/short positons,
i use to run my own market making (think of it as my own prop trading firm) platform on Bitfinex to tried to make money on the spread, however,
the spread their is way too thin, and unless i have huge captipal in the millions, my trading strategies wouldn't work due to fees and already high liquidity in
lower risk assets, and i am relunctant to trade in higher spread, low liquidity assets due to fear of holding inventory as I cannot take that amount of risk.
- I also have made substantial profits in swing trading, capitalize on the current crypto markets, especially with the recent Bitcoin ETFs approval by the US SEC
for blackrock, fidelity, among others, so i'm just riding the market as of now and probably will retire by the time i reach age 50.

GREATEST
Greatest achievement is saving a company from complete bankrupty, but that has nothing to do with Fintech, but everything about revamping their tech stack,
architecture, and completely upgrade their database, such as improved efficiency, configurating DB specs based on hardware capacity, how much it can handle, etc.
Identified all the issues in DB performance, using index, explain keyword to see execution plan, using store procedures and views more often, and rewriting SQL
queries to be way more efficient, about 1000x improvement which saved the company

QUESTIONS
what is the work life balance, and what is your WFH policy and what is your agile schedule is, assuming you are using SCRUM, (planning, standup, estimation, review, retrospective) 
- between 1-10, what is the stress level of you and your team
- KInd of far, in Kwong Tong and not near MTR (can work 3 times a day from home?)
i know that this is a FIX connectivity L2/L3 support, so i would i have to deal with clients myself or work more closely with developers or even have a chance
to work on the coding itself on the FIX issues.
- Am i required to at client site on demand, for troubleshooting, help with FIX connectivity issues?
- In your view, what sort of achievement or success means to you for new joiners that joins your company that you think can meet or exceed those expectations?

â€¢chaos engineering preferred. ????? panic modes, production issues, and require OT and traveling onsite to clients to resolve issues?
